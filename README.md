# Supervised_Learning
## *This was a Supervised Learning project for TripleTen. 👩🏽‍💻*
This project developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn for Beta Bank, achieving an F1 score of 0.61 and a strong AUC-ROC score despite class imbalance. By targeting likely-to-leave customers, the model provides a tool for optimizing retention strategies and aligning predictions with actual churn trends. This approach offers Beta Bank a data-driven solution to reduce customer attrition and secure its future.
